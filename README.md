# Getting Started
Run this program using the Driver.java class, which contains the Main method. 

# To Use- Cheat Keys:
1. '1', '2' and '3' go to respective levels
2. 'R' resets current level
3. 'L' replenishes all lives

# Bugs
1. If the ball hits the side of the paddle, the paddle may carry and release the ball in a random direction
2. Follow the instruction exactly to start the game (e.g. only hit the ENTER key to avoid errors)

# Features 
* Levels: Get harder by increasing ball speed, complicating formation

* Power-ups:
1. Green Ball- gives additional ball
2. Red ball- grows paddle (only once)
3. Blue ball- extra life

* Paddle Abilities:
1. Grows
2. Ball bounces differently depending on section
3. Goes faster as it moves in the same direction

* Blocks:
1. Single-hit block
2. Multi-hit block
3. Bounce block

* Something Extra: Snowball falls- if intersect, lose a life

# Impressions
This is my first time doing a large coding project. Although I struggled a bit in the high-level organization of my code, I think the assignment is great for students just beginning to start programming large projects. If anything, the 3-feature requirement for objects like the paddle was a little exhaustive and tedious.
